## ⚙️ Installation Guide (Local Development)

Follow these steps to set up and run MoneyMap on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js & npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Git:** Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **MongoDB Atlas Account:** Create a free-tier account and set up a cluster on(https://cloud.mongodb.com/). Obtain your connection string.[13, 14]

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ganesh-kambalimath/-Budget-Tracker-Web-.git](https://github.com/Ganesh-kambalimath/-Budget-Tracker-Web-.git)
    cd -Budget-Tracker-Web-
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and another `.env` file in the `client/` directory.
    *   Copy the contents from the `.env.example` file (located in the root directory) into both of your newly created `.env` files.
    *   **For `server/.env`:**
        *   `MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` (Replace with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string, ensuring your username and password are correct and special characters are URL-encoded if necessary).[13, 14, 15]
        *   `JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here` (Generate a strong, random string for JWT secret).
        *   `PORT=5000` (Or any desired port for the backend).
    *   **For `client/.env`:**
        *   `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` (If using Vite, adjust port if your backend runs on a different one).
        *   **Important:** Remember that frontend environment variables are publicly accessible after deployment. Do not store sensitive information here.[11]

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd../client
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd../server
    npm start # Or `node index.js`
    ```
    You should see a message indicating the server is running and connected to MongoDB.

6.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    cd../client
    npm run dev # If using Vite, or `npm start` if using Create React App
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💡 Usage

*   **Register:** Create a new account on the `/register` page.
*   **Login:** Sign in with your credentials on the `/login` page.
*   **Dashboard:** Explore your personalized dashboard (`/dashboard`) to view financial summaries and charts.
*   **Add Transactions:** Use the forms to input your income and expenses, assigning them to relevant categories.
*   **Reports:** Generate and download monthly reports to keep track of your financial progress.

## ☁️ Deployment

MoneyMap is designed for deployment on cloud platforms like Render or Railway, which offer free tiers suitable for personal projects.

*   **Backend Deployment (e.g., Render):** The `server/` directory is deployed as a Node.js Web Service. Ensure all backend environment variables are configured on the Render dashboard.[5]
*   **Frontend Deployment (e.g., Render):** The `client/` directory is deployed as a Static Site. The `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend's environment variables must be updated to point to your deployed backend's URL.[5]

*(Note: While Cyclic was previously an option, it is currently shutting down, so Render or Railway are recommended alternatives.)*
